This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).  Here's where all my original and reworked creative data visualizations will go to live. Enjoy exploring!

# About Me
Hi! I am a Masters of Information Systems Management with a focus in Business Intelligence and Data Analytics (MISM-BIDA) student at Heinz College, CMU. I am in my first year and will graduate in May 2026. I have experience in Java, Python, finance analytics, and statistical analysis. I am trying to expand my knowledge from conducting analyses to how to display it by taking this course.

# What I Hope to Learn
I have never considered myself to be a particularly creative person, but in just a few classes (and required reading assignments) I have come to realize you do not need to be an artist to produce good visuals. In critiques, a lot of the issues that arise can be identified by the average person because of how the human brain processes information. Additionally, with the rise of social media in our everyday lives, we are developing opinions on what we like and do not like visually even if we do not realize it. With all that being said, here are the top three things I hope to learn in the next few weeks:

- Create engaging visualizations that draw in the reader rather than cause them to gloss it over
- Find the balance between simple yet effective visuals
- Discover new styles of charts for representing data

[Part I](final-project-part-one.md)
For Part I, the primary focus was choosing a topic and drafting an initial outline of what the final story would look like. As part of this process, it included getting intial datasets to use for visualzations, as well. In class, we did critiques on our classmates ideas prior to submission so that we could make any necessary changes. This process helped to narrow down the story and start thinking about the audience.

[Part II](final-project-part-two.md)
For Part II, I moved from an idea to an actual storyboard using Shorthand. This gave us the opportunity to move all our ideas into an actual platform and see how accurate we could represent our story. An integral aspect of this was conducting interivews with peers and classmates for any final adjustments prior to the final part.

[Part III](final-project-part-three.md)
For Part III, I had to submit my final story link and give an in-class presentation. There was no further changes after this point, though we did conduct critique forms during each presentation. I can use whatever critiques I recevied for future storytelling.
