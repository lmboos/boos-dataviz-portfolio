# Redesign of "The World's Biggest Military Spenders"

## Step one: the visualization
After browsing several Makeover Monday visuals, I decided on a visual that has significance to me. As a member of the US Army, I was intrigued by the military spending visual. It was no surprise to see the United States as the biggest spender, but I did not realize by how much. A few countries in the top 10 were surprising as well, like India and the United Kingdom. The source website had two visuals to depict the military spending. First, a unique take on a pie chart for spending in 2021. Then, there was a supporting table showing spending from 2017 to 2021, but only for half of the top 10 nations that are included in the first chart.

</div>

## Step two: the critique
For the critique portion of this exercise, I completed a Google Form where I rated the visual on a sliding scale, as well as with short responses. The primary critiques I had of the visuals were that the color scheme and shapes on the pie chart added no value. At first, I thought the color scheme was a type of gradient with darker green indicating greater spending and vice versa. However, after looking closer, the colors did not have any clear association with the countries. Also, a pie chart should be split into slices, but instead he had obscure shapes that made it harder for me to grasp the size differences. Finally, his incorporation of a table I thought was a good idea to further support his pie chart, but then I realized he only included data for half of the countries. 

## Step three: Sketch a solution
For my sketch I split it into two sections - recreating the pie chart and redesigning the table to show trends. I had two ideas for each sketch as shown below.

## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask (modify these for your own interviews): 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Results: 

_Don't identify or share personally identifiable information (PII) about the people you spoke to._


| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |

Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step five: build the solution

<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1739414989453' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Military Spender Dashboard ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;J4&#47;J4WCPH5TY&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='path' value='shared&#47;J4WCPH5TY' /> <param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;J4&#47;J4WCPH5TY&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /><param name='ignore_sticky_session' value='yes' /></object></div>                <script type='text/javascript'>                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1739414989453');                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 800 ) { vizElement.style.width='1000px';vizElement.style.height='827px';} else if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 500 ) { vizElement.style.width='1000px';vizElement.style.height='827px';} else { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height='977px';}                     var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                </script>

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
