# Final Project Part I

## Outline
> Summary: 
 
As an avid traveler and lover of planning, I want to create a visualization related to picking the best travel spot. As this is a broad topic, I narrowed it down to US National Parks during summer break (May - August). I will use visualizations to map out locations of these parks, compare prices of factors such as travel, accommodation, and food, then rank the level of importance for each consideration. The US has a total of 63 National Parks, which is quite a large number to produce data for. Instead, I plan on narrowing it down to the top five or ten destinations based on a mix of popularity, my personal interests, and variety amongst the parks. The project name is "Process of Finding the Perfect National Park Destination". 

> Project Structure:  

**Set-up** - Identify the locations of the parks being considered. I will create a metric that weighs certain aspects in comparison to others. This metric will likely look at price, popularity (number of people), temperature, and food variety. Along with each factor, I will have a scale for what I do not want to surpass or list of what is important for each one. 

**Conflict** - Choosing which National Park is best with data visualization! This initial data representation will provide the background information necessary to start the process of narrowing down the best destination.  First I will look at expected costs, followed by entrance fees/permits associated with each park, into a chart visuzliaing visitation rates. From there I will visualize how far each park is from major points of interest, such as the airport, lodging, other state/national parks, metropolitan area, and nearest hospital. To close out there will be a chart listing activities available in each park, along with a heat map representing average temperatures in each park.

**Resolution** - Having followed the metric created during the set-up process, I will present which National Park is best and why. In this section, I will finish with the call to action, suggesting viewers utilize methods similar to the story shown here, or redirect them to the National Park Website for personal research. I also plan on including photos of the winning park to showcase the beauty of "my next travel destination".

## Data
I will pull data primarily from travel sites and the National Park Service site. Most of it will be manual extraction, though a few sites have compiled data that I can download and further refine for my use. Below lists the data sources gathered from initial searches. The first three in the table I will download and visualize in a new way. For the following four, I will pull data manually from the source then create a CSV to upload into Tableau.

## Method and medium
To present the final project, I will use Tableau to create the data presentations and Shorthand for telling the story. Additionally, I may explore Flourish as an alternate way to visualize data.
