## Final Project Part I

# Outline
> Summary: 
 
As an avid traveler and lover of planning, I want to create a visualization related to picking the best travel spot. As this is a broad topic, I narrowed it down to US National Parks during the first week of summer break (May 5 - 9, 2025). I will use visualizations to map out locations of these parks, compare prices of factors such as travel, accommodation, and food, and rank the level of importance for each consideration. The US has a total of 63 National Parks, which is quite a large number to produce data for. Instead, I plan on narrowing it down to the top five or ten destinations based on a mix of popularity, my personal interests, and variety amongst the parks. The project name is "Finding the Perfect National Park Destination". 

> Project Structure:  

**Set-up** - Identify the locations of the parks being considered. Present their accessibility to nearest airports and whether permits are required. Along with this, I will start the comparison of flight prices, rental cars, lodging, food, visitation, and restaurants. This will provide all the background information necessary to start the process of narrowing down the best destination.

**Conflict** - Choosing which National Park is best! I will create a metric (that is probably biased) that weighs certain aspects in comparison to others. This metric will likely look at price, popularity (number of people), temperature, and food variety.

**Resolution** - Having followed the metric created during conflict stage, I will present which National Park is best and why.  

# Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

# The data
I will pull data primarily from travel sites and the National Park Service site. Most of it will be manual extraction, though a few sites have compiled data that I can download and further refine for my use.

> Sources of data:

| Name | URL | Description |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| National Park Service - Entrance Fees by Park | https://www.nps.gov/aboutus/entrance-fee-prices.htm   | Identifies fees for each National Park service site |
| Google Flights | https://www.google.com/travel/flights | Provides price for flight information |
| Kayak | https://www.kayak.com    | Compare rental car and lodging prices for travel destinations |
| NPS Stats | https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/ | View annual or monthly visitor rates for National Park service sites |
| Destination Parks | https://www.destinationparks.com/resource/weather-averages-national-parks.php | National Park weather averages by month |
| Google Maps | https://www.google.com/maps | See nearby restaurants and airpots |

# Method and medium
To present the final project, I will use Tableau to create the data presentations and Shorthand for telling the story.
