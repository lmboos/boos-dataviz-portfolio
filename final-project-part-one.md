# Outline
> Summary: 
 
As an avid traveler and lover of planning, I want to create a visualization related to picking the best travel spot. As this is a broad topic, I narrowed it down to US National Parks during the first week of summer break (May 5 - 9, 2025). I will use visualizations to map out locations of these parks, compare prices of factors such as travel, accommodation, and food, and rank the level of importance for each consideration. The US has a total of 63 National Parks, which is quite a large number to produce data for. Instead, I plan on narrowing it down to the top five or ten destinations based on a mix of popularity, my personal interests, and variety amongst the parks. The project name is "Finding the Perfect National Park Destination". 

> Project Structure:  

**Set-up** - Identify the locations of the parks being considered. Present their accessibility to nearest airports and whether permits are required. Along with this, I will start the comparison of flight prices, rental cars, lodging, food, visitation, and restaurants. This will provide all the background information necessary to start the process of narrowing down the best destination.

**Conflict** - Choosing which National Park is best! I will create a metric (that is probably biased) that weighs certain aspects in comparison to others. This metric will likely look at price, popularity (number of people), temperature, and food variety.

**Resolution** - Having followed the metric created during conflict stage, I will present which National Park is best and why.  

# Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

# The data
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data.

> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.
