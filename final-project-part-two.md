# Storyboard
For my storyboard, I began creating the Shorthand draft of my final presentation. The primary focus was to have a format of where each section would go. Once that was established, I began working on the visualizations to support each section. Here is the storyboard link to see the progress so far:

# User Research 

## Target audience
The audience for my story is travel and nature loving college / graduate students. I want to motivate people to explore the United States' natural beauty and believe the student demographic is the best people for that given the extensive summer break. In the end, I would like my audience to be able to adapt the planning strategy and decision matrix to their own national park travel in the future. 

## Interview script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|  Clear audience    |  Is there a better way to define the audience in the introduction? How much text should be included in each section? |
|  Defined call to action    | What is the best way to tie in the current NPS cuts into my call to action? |
|  Simple, but efficient and capturing visuals    |  What changes would you make to the decision matrix? Any other insights on how to improve the visualizaton aspect? |


## Interview findings
Interview 1: MISM-BIDA student, part of TSWD class

Interview 2: MISM student, part of TSWD class

Interview 3: MAM student, part of TSWD class

Interview 4: MAM student, TA for TSWD class

Interview 5: MISM-BIDA student, not in TSWD class

| Questions               | Interview 1  | Interview 2 | Interview 3 | Interview 4 | Interview 5 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------| ----------- | ----------- |
| Is there a better way to define the audience in the introduction? | N/A            | N/A             | N/A            | In the intro identify the audience as college students            | Define a persona and stick with it throughout the story            |
| How much text should be included in each section?                       | Focus on visuals and only add text to support                               | N/A            | N/A            | Text is a good tool for more complicated visuals            | Text does not hurt, but apply it only as necessary to aid understanding, but visuals should not be reliant on it            |
| What is the best way to tie in the current NPS cuts into my call to action?                        | N/A                               | Make the planning tools available to viewer             | N/A            | Reference NPS and NPCA in call to action section            | N/A            |
| What changes would you make to the decision matrix?  | N/A                               | Make it interactive so people can alter the matrix weights as they prefer            | No changes - appreciates the selection criteria            | In the final decision, consider visually representing it with radar charts rather than just the matrix            | Add a blank spot for another park and highlight winner in final section           |
| Any other insights on how to improve the visualizaton aspect?  | Keep the table of contents and consider adding tabs to the top like we saw in class                               | As much interactivity as possible            | Break up each section with a header rather than jumping right into it            | N/A            | In proximity section break up sements using color in addition to distance            |


# Identified Changes for Part III
As I received feedback, I would try to implement it, so the table below may include some changes that already occurred into ones that I will work on prior to the final presentation. 

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Defining concrete persona | I will reword the text of each section so that it is not about me / generalized, but rather the person going on this trip |
| Interactivity             | Work with the matrix in particular to see if users can edit it                                              |
| Refine visualizations     | Use color and attention grabbing visuals to keep the viewers engaged                                        |
| Get creative with visualizing  | With proximity and activity sections, there might be betters ways to have the final visual instead of line and pie chart respectively     |

The largest challenge I am facing is figuring out how to present what I see in my brain onto Shorthand. I think Shorthand is great tool, but I need a lot more practice to get to the point that I want. I think I have set myself up for success (for the most part) to finish up the project for the final presentation. I will have to add in my visuals and choose how I want to display the activities section, but I am not worried. I am enjoying the flexibility and creativity of this project, and I am excited to see the end results for my classmates.
