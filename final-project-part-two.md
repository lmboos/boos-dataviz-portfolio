# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project. 

For my storyboard, I began creating the Shorthand draft of my final presentation. The primary focus was to have a format of where each section would go. Once that was established, I began working on the visualizations to support each section. Here is the storyboard link to see the progress so far:


# User research 

## Target audience
The audience for my story is travel / nature loving college and graduate students. I want to motivate people to explore the United States' natural beauty and believe the college / graduate student demographic is the best people for that given the extensive summer break. At the end of the day, I would like my audience to be able to adapt the planning strategy to their own life, so the decision matrix and categories could apply to future national park destination planning. 

## Interview script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|  Clear audience    |  Is there a better way to define the audience in the introduction? How much text should be included in each section? |
|  Defined call to action    | What is the best way to tie in the current NPS cuts into my call to action? |
|  Simple, but efficient and capturing visuals    |  What changes would you make to the decision matrix? Any other insights on how to improve the visualizaton aspect? |

# Identified changes for Part III
As I received feedback, I would try to implement it, so the table below may include some changes that already occurred into ones that I will work on prior to the final presentation.
