# The Final Data Story
[Find Your Perfect National Park Destination](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/national-park-planner/index.html) 

# Changes Made Since Part II
Since the completion of Part II, I finished all my visuals and reworked aspects of some that had already been created. One piece of feedback that I received from several interviewees was to make my decision matrix interactive. To accomplish this I changed it from a Shorthand table, to an excel table that I then embedded into my story. People cannot edit it directly on the page, however, they can copy it for their own use. Next, I reconsidered how I would do the activity section. Originally, I thought a pie chart would be a good way to visualize it, but then realized that it might be confusing as I am not truly showing parts of a greater whole. Instead, I did a simple write up for each park. I realized that in some instances a visual is not the best option for portraying the message you want. Finally, most of my time was spent creating, editing, and embedding visuals, including the visitor line plot, weather heat maps, proximity bubbles, and budget bar charts. 

I created all my visuals in Tableau, except for the decision matrix. If I had more time, I would have explored more with Datawrapper and RAWgraphs, as some of my classmates charts from these sites seemed cleaner and easier to manipulate in terms of centering and sizing. I struggled a bit with Tableau embeds not producing the full visual, so I turned to ChatGPT (as described below) to assist. Two things I was not able to figure out were:
- how to have my visual in the center, rather than aligned left or right depending on the format of that section
- how to make the visual transparent so it matched the background of the rest of the page - to mitigate this I chose netural background colors 

## The Audience
One thing identified in Part II was inconsistency with the audience throughout my story. To mitigate this, I followed the advice of my professor and TA to make the story about me! For the purpose of my story, all sections and decision criteria were built around my preferences. However, I make it a point to say that I hope other people learn from my planning strategy and use it for their future travels. Upon presentation day, I received one comment from the audience that they liked how the story was told from my perspective, because they felt it was more relatable and easy to connect with. This process made me realize that despite it being a public story, people like to learn about other individual's experiences. When I plan trips, I often find myself reading blog posts and watching videos made by others that provide recommendations, itineraries, and offer advice on how to plan. So, I think my page is similar in that it could help guide and motivate someone to plan a trip in the future.

## Final Design Decisions
> You can specifically break out your design decisions here, or include it under *Changes made since Part II* and delete this section. Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process.  Include any other information that helps round out your data story. 

One thing I realized during this design process is that everyone will have different opinions and thoughts on how data should be represented, but that does not mean you need to follow their advice. Whether it is an issue of time, preference, or not fitting your goal, it is ok to stick to what you think is best for your story. I received some advice during the interviews that I chose not to follow because I did not think it would add anything to my story. As we learned in class, there is a point when visuals are too much and simpler is better.

## References
All references used in the creation of my story are listed on Shorthand.

## AI acknowledgements
I used generative AI to adjust my visualizations' embed codes. When I originally published my tableau graphics, they did not fit the screen, so you had to scroll to see the visual in its entirety. I learned to change width to 100% in the embed code to fix this problem. Additionally, it taught me how to get embed code from an excel file, which is how I made my decision matrix.
